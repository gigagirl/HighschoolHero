      <p><b>A Microscope in the Kitchen</b>
        <br>

I grew up with buckets, shovels, and nets <u>waiting by the back door;</u>(1) hip-waders hanging in the closet; tide table charts covering the refrigerator door; and a microscope <u>was sitting</u>(2) on the kitchen table. <u>Having studied, my mother is</u>(3) a marine biologist. <u>Our household might have been described as uncooperative.</u>(4) Our meals weren&#8217;t always served in the expected order of breakfast, lunch, and supper. Everything <u>was subservient to the disposal of</u>(5) the tides. When the tide was low, Mom could be found down on the mudflats. When the tide was high, she would be standing on the inlet bridge with her plankton net.

<u>I have great respect for my mother.</u>(6) I learned early that the moon affected the tides. Mom was always waiting for a full or new moon, when low tide would be lower than average and high tide higher than average. <u>The moon being</u>(7) aligned with Earth and the sun when full or new, so <u>its</u>(8) gravity combines with the sun&#8217;s gravity to create an even stronger gravitational pull.<u> I knew that it took about eight hours for the tides to change from high to low, sixteen hours for a complete cycle of tides</u>(9). I didn&#8217;t have to wait to learn these things in school. In our house they were everyday knowledge.

[1] Often, <u>my brother and I,</u>(10) joined our mother on her adventures into tidal lands. [2] At the very low tides of the full moon, when almost all the water was sucked <u>away, we</u>(11) found the <u>hideaways where crabs, snails, starfish, and sea urchins hid in order not to be seen.</u>(12)[3] Sometimes we would dig with shovels in the mud, where yellow and white worms lived in their leathery tunnels. <u>13</u>(13)

For plankton tows, we would stand on the bridge while Mom lowered a cone-shaped net that <u>is often used by marine biologists.</u>(14) Then we would patiently wait. After a while, she would pull up the net, and we would go home. Later, we would see her sitting at the kitchen table, peering <u>at a drop of water</u>(15) through the lenses of her microscope from the bottle-watching the thousands of tiny swimming organisms.</p>
